        <div class="note-container"><h1>How I Compute</h1>
<p>As of late 2024, my only computer is a Lenovo T480 laptop with an almost (5) year old installation of Arch Linux.
This laptop has been solid with no HW failures or HW compatibility issues whatsoever.
On the O/S side, I've been daily driving Arch since 2013 (over a decade now!) on various devices.  With Arch, I
am able to enjoy a light-weight, minimalistic, and customizable computing experience that is difficult to replicate
with many other distributions or operating systems.</p>
<h2>My Setup</h2>
<pre><code>laptop: T480 (8th gen i5-8250U) with 32GB RAM and dual heatsink mod
O/S: arch linux 
desktop environment: xfce
IDE: neovim / tmux
notes: obsidian / neovim
PDF: zathura
image vhewer: qimgv 
browser: firefox
</code></pre>
<h2>Repair, Don't Re-Install</h2>
<p>Not all has gone smoothly, however.  I've managed to blow up my Arch install several times throughout the years, all resulting from my own
ignorance.  Once, upon reverting back to X11 after trying out Wayland, another time when I switched from PulseAudio to
Pipewire to get some wireless headphones to work, and most recently when I messed up my bootloader and EFI configuration
during an attempt to repair an aborted system upgrade with <code>pacman</code>.  Initially, my approach was to re-install Arch
using a LiveUSB whenever I encountered a significant issue that I could not resolve expediently.  My approach changed as I gained
more experience and I started using tools like <code>timeshift</code> to quickly restore, avoiding lost time and effort. Over the last several years my philosophy
has further evolved to prefer isolating the root cause and repairing my installation — I find this is the most effective way to learn.</p></div>
